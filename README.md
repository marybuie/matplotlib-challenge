# matplotlib-challenge
I used Stack Overflow and matplotlib.org extensively throughout this assignment 
as I needed help with the syntax, especially for .groupy() functions. I also used statology.org and geeksforgeeks.org as references. 
I sourced code for all of my graphs from geeksforgeeks.org, tutorialspoint.org, and matplotlib.org.
